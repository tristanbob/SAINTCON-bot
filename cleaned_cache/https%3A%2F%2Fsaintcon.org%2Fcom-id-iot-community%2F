**Title:** COM - ID-IOT Community

**Overview:** 
The ID-IOT Community brings together individuals interested in exploring Industrial Devices and IoT challenges. Hosted by Spectre and Phaktor, the community welcomes discussions on the complexities of control systems and their cybersecurity implications.

**Key Message:**
From last year's revelations about the vulnerabilities of operational technology (OT) and industrial control systems (ICS), the community aims to deepen understanding of these issues and provide a platform for learning.

**Community Objectives:**
- Explore control systems and their security issues, including vulnerabilities in PLCs and the challenges posed by proprietary protocols.
- Facilitate discussions about protocol manipulation (e.g., Modbus and DNP3) and IoT device security.
- Encourage the use of tools such as PyDNP3, Snap7, pylogix, and pymodbus for hands-on learning.
- Provide opportunities for hacking IoT devices and understanding their vulnerabilities through firmware analysis and interaction with debugging capabilities.

**Activities:**
- Workshops and discussions about control systems, IoT vulnerabilities, and ethical hacking practices.
- Engaging with Python tools to manipulate protocols and secure infrastructure.

**Hours of Operation:**
- Monday: Closed 
- Tuesday: 10:30 AM – 5:00 PM
- Wednesday: 10:30 AM – 5:00 PM
- Thursday: 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM
- Friday: 9:00 AM – 11:00 AM

**Learning Outcomes:**
Participants will learn:
- Connecting to and understanding ICS systems.
- Insights on control protocols and management of IoT challenges.

**MiniBadge:**
The community will offer a MiniBadge for attendees, with details to be shared at the community booth.

**Wallpaper Availability:**
Desktop wallpapers related to the community are available for download.
