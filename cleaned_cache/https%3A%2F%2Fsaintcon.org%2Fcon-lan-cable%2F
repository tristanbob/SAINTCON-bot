**Event Title:** CON - LAN Cable Contest  
**Event Description:**  
The LAN Cable Contest invites participants to build a LAN cable as quickly as possible. Participants can be beginners or experienced cable makers, and can compete for the fastest crimping time while adhering to TIA-568 A or B standards.

**Organized by:** v0rtex  
**Event Location:** SAINTCON  

**Mission:**  
1. Wire and crimp jacks on both ends of a network cable accurately and as quickly as possible (no crossovers).
2. Test the cable by plugging it into RJ-45 jacks.
3. Record the time taken to successfully crimp and test the cable.

**Overview:**  
Timing devices and tools will be provided. Competitors can track their times against a leaderboard.

**What to Bring:**  
Participants need only bring themselves; all necessary tools will be supplied.

**Skills Required:**  
No prior skills are needed—beginners can learn and practice multiple times.

**Event Rules:**  
1. Assign a username at the booth.
2. Ensure tool readiness and that no ends are crimped before starting.
3. Each attempt requires starting with uncrimped ends.
4. Choose TIA-568A or B standards; no crossover cables allowed.
