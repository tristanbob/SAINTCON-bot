**Event Title**: CON - LAN Cable Contest  
**Host**: v0rtex  
**Description**: Participants will build a network cable as quickly as possible, adhering to TIA-568 A or B standards without using crossover cables. The contest tests RJ-45 crimping skills, and times are recorded based on successful connections. 

**Overview**:  
- Timing and testing will occur at the booth.
- Participants will receive tools, cable length, and ends.
- The leaderboard displays participant times.

**What to Bring**: Participants only need to bring themselves, as tools will be provided.

**Skills Required**: No prior skills needed; beginners can observe and learn.

**Rules**:  
1. Provide a name/username to the booth volunteer.
2. Have all materials ready before starting.
3. Each attempt begins with no ends crimped; the cable must be cut off before a retry.
4. Choose between two wiring standards (TIA-568A or TIA-568B).
5. Start the timer by pressing a button; timing stops when a correctly crimped cable is plugged in.
