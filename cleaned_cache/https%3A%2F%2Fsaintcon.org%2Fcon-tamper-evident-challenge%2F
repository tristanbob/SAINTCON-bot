**Overview:**  
This year's F.I.B Tamper Challenge involves breaking into a package to alter some evidence. The challenge consists of two sections: Beginner and Advanced. Teams are limited to two people and can compete in both sections.

Participants will deal with packages containing multiple layers of tamper-evident devices, aiming to reach the center of the package, retrieve and alter data, and reassemble everything without leaving a trace.

**Gameplay Rules:**
- Get into the package undetected and leave no trace.
- In case of a tie, speed is the deciding factor.
- Do not destroy game materials; doing so will result in point deductions.
- Teams are limited to two participants.
- All game materials must be returned, regardless of success.

**Important Notes:**
- **Sign-Up:** Participants must sign up at the Tamper Evident Community booth. Limited spots available.
- **Preparation:** Research different types of tamper-evident devices and bring necessary tools.
