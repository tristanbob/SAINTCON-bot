**Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

**General**

1. **What is SAINTCON?**
   - **Answer:** SAINTCON is the annual cyber-security conference presented by the Utah Security Advisory and Incident Network Team ("UtahSAINT"). This event is an IT and Cyber-Security Professionals conference with a hard focus on cyber-security topics. The conference began in 2001 and has been held throughout the State of Utah. Prior to 2013, this event was called the UtahSAINT Conference, but was renamed to be more recognizable and could flourish on its own.

2. **What happens at SAINTCON?**
   - **Answer:** Most people come to listen to the Presentations and Trainings, but year by year we continue to bring more and more elements into the conference. While the presentations are great, we provide a rich experience that allows attendees to focus on things that interest them the most. Games and Contests are a major part of SAINTCON. Many people spend their entire time at the conference (and in their hotels) playing the Hackers Challenge game. Hackers Challenge was originally used to provide “Something else to do” during less interesting presentations, but has become a serious and high skills driven game that the attendees love to play.

3. **How much does it cost to attend SAINTCON?**
   - **Answer:** Somewhere between $200-$300. SAINTCON ticket costs change from year-to-year based on the projected costs for the conference. As a general cost-recovery conference, we will set the cost as low as possible to cover costs with a small margin of surplus to cover unexpected costs should they arise.

4. **Will I get hacked at SAINTCON?**
   - **Answer:** Probably not! We do a lot of security education at SAINTCON, so it may be only natural for someone to be super-excited and test a new skill against their network-connected friends. This is discouraged, but cannot be completely controlled. We recommend that you come to the conference with a certain level of paranoia and protect yourself and your devices appropriately by using VPNs and other methods.

5. **Where and When is SAINTCON held?**
   - **Answer:** SAINTCON 2023 will be held from October 21-25, 2024 at the Utah Valley Convention Center – 220 West Center Street, Suite 200 Provo UT, 84601.

6. **Is there an Age Limit to attend SAINTCON?**
   - **Answer:** No! In fact, we encourage you to bring younger attendees to SAINTCON. We have expanded this option in recent years, and have found that much of what we do and discuss is beneficial to High School students and younger. SAINTCON has a long tradition of being a family-friendly environment, even though we do not monitor or enforce this culture. 
     - **Policy:** All attendees younger than 18 years old MUST be accompanied by an adult.

7. **Who makes money off SAINTCON?**
   - **Answer:** Nobody… SAINTCON is a labor of love and has no paid staff. The planning committee only receives our gratitude and a couple of thank-you items and perks for their year-long work. Several years ago we started providing compensation for contractors and enhanced content providers for things like Trainings, Keynotes, Badge design, etc. These honorariums are very reasonable and often barely cover the cost of their time. SAINTCON is a non-profit endeavor, and we spend nearly every dollar we collect from registration on the event each year. We usually end up with around $15-20k/yr of surplus that we retain in a budget for the next year startup costs, and to pay organization bills (storage leases, subscriptions, accounting, etc.).

8. **What are Minibadges and why are they so popular?**
   - **Answer:** Loosely defined, MiniBadges are small electronic-based components, usually approximately 1” by 1” square designed on a circuit-board. MiniBadges are generally designed to plug into the SAINTCON Conference Badge for power and sometimes more. The MiniBadge concept was the original brain-child of “zZq” and shared with the UtahSAINT Community. Since the beginning, MiniBadge popularity has exploded with the average number of MiniBadges each year well over 17,000. Over the years, we have seen some incredibly creative designs, and many from individuals with little to no design experience. Each year we are impressed to see how many new designs appear. It is VERY common to now have ~8-10% of conference attendees bringing their own minibadges to SAINTCON to trade. We highly encourage newcomers to check out and learn MiniBadge design skills. It’s an extremely useful skill for the geeks in the world. Minibadges can be super simple or super complex. We have seen minibadges with just 1 or 2 LEDs to fully-functional computers designed to do various things. Learning how to build them is not difficult, and we have several tutorials on YouTube to help you get started. The popularity of MiniBadges is not too different from Pokémon™ cards, Olympic pins, or other collectibles. Value is in the eye of the beholder.

9. **What is SAINTCON Family Night?**
   - **Answer:** Family Night is an annual event held in conjunction with SAINTCON where we invite attendees of the conference to bring their family to participate in a kid-oriented version of the conference. It often includes STEM-based activities, presentations, and fun interactions for younger people.

**Registration**

1. **Can I add a training after I’ve already registered for SAINTCON?**
   - **Answer:** Yes! As long as the training has not reached its attendance cap, you can add a training to your registration. If you do not know the password for your SAINTCON 2024 Registration Account, start on our Password Reset page and submit your registered email address. Then visit your SAINTCON 2024 Registration Account and login with your email address and password. After you login, you can select and purchase the training you want.

2. **What should I do if I didn’t receive my receipt via email?**
   - **Answer:** We recommend you start by checking your spam and junk filters in case those block the receipt. We have a self-service option to send another copy of a receipt to the registered e-mail address at https://register.saintcon.org/receipt. This form requires the e-mail address used to register for the conference and will send another copy of the receipt to that e-mail address.

3. **Why are discount tickets no longer available?**
   - **Answer:** For many years, SAINTCON has offered discount tickets for qualifying groups or people. In 2021, we realized that the logistics involved in offering discounts created a logistical problem that was reaching a tipping point in time, resources, and coordination. So, we decided from 2022 on, we will no longer provide discounts for normal registrations. Along with this change, we have formalized two new programs which we believe address the majority of the discount needs. These are the "Scholarship Program" and the "Student Group Program". With these two programs, we hope to continue to provide for the needs of the community where finances are a major issue and appreciate your understanding of our need to reduce the logistical load on an all-volunteer administrative team.

4. **When does Registration Open?**
   - **Answer:** Registration for SAINTCON usually begins in the first half of July. Watch the website for more specific updates.

5. **Will you ship my conference materials if I am unable to attend the conference in person?**
   - **Answer:** No. We are unable to provide shipping for conference materials.

**Content**

1. **How do I get involved in SAINTCON?**
   - **Answer:** Involvement in SAINTCON is an organic thing. Many of the people involved in the conference just seem to show up and start helping. Soon after, they realize what they have gotten themselves into, but by then it’s too late. These days however, we strive for a little more organization than we have in the past. To get involved all you need to do is be willing to help, and reach out to one of the members of the Conference Committee. Our most formal process for getting involved begins with our Call for Volunteers which occurs in the May/June timeframe.

2. **How can I speak/present at SAINTCON?**
   - **Answer:** You can submit a response to our Call for Papers. All entries are evaluated by the conference committee and those chosen are notified soon after the CFP closes. CFP for SAINTCON is generally done in two phases:
     - Phase 1 – Open Call for anyone to submit.
     - Phase 2 – Finding presenters for content gaps.
     Details will be prominently displayed on the event website and generally occurs in the April/May timeframe.

3. **How do you handle seating in Trainings/Workshops?**
   - **Answer:** Trainings and Workshops are available on a first-come, first-served basis. As long as there’s a seat available and the session hasn’t reached the Trainer’s maximum, anyone is able to join the session. NOTE: There may be changes to this process.

4. **I’m not a Security Professional, should I attend SAINTCON?**
   - **Answer:** Maybe… SAINTCON is not just for IT and Security professionals, but for anyone who has an interest in cyber-security. If cyber-security, hacking, security research, or other similar things interest you, you will likely enjoy SAINTCON.

5. **Is SAINTCON just for State Government/Education entities?**
   - **Answer:** No! SAINTCON has grown from a strong interaction from Public Education but is not limited to this mission. We continue to expand the conference to include private corporations and non-education entities. We feel that this strengthens our conference and the UtahSAINT Organization. SAINTCON is open to anyone and everyone who would like to attend. We will always continue however to have an education focus in key areas; however, Network Security does not differ significantly in application.

**Other**

1. **How are you handling COVID-related issues?**
   - **Answer:** UtahSAINT and SAINTCON are concerned about the health and well-being of our community. We are critical-thinkers and tend to follow the science and recommendations from appropriate authorities. In the end, SAINTCON will only require safety precautions that are mandated by Federal, State, or Local authorities, and nothing more.

2. **When does Call for Sponsors begin?**
   - **Answer:** We value the involvement of sponsors in this event. It is in large part because of sponsor involvement that we can do as much as we do in this community event. Call for Sponsors is the official process for becoming involved in the event. SAINTCON has ~20 sponsor slots available each year. Call for Sponsors begins in the early-July timeframe.

3. **Where can I park when attending SAINTCON?**
   - **Answer:** SAINTCON is held at the Utah Valley Convention Center in Provo. 
     - **Please Note:** The parking we’ve previously used that is south of Smith’s is no longer free. We recommend you take a look at the UVCC parking information page here: [Parking](https://utahvalleycc.com/parking/).
