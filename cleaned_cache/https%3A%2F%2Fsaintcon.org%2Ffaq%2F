Here are the extracted questions and answers from the FAQ content:

1. **What is SAINTCON?**
   - SAINTCON is the annual cyber-security conference presented by the Utah Security Advisory and Incident Network Team (“UtahSAINT”). This event is an IT and Cyber-Security Professionals conference with a hard focus on cyber-security topics. The conference began in 2001 and has been held throughout the State of Utah. Prior to 2013, this event was called the UtahSAINT Conference, but was renamed to be more recognizable and could flourish on its own.

2. **What happens at SAINTCON?**
   - Most people come to listen to the Presentations and Trainings, but year by year we continue to bring more and more elements into the conference. While the presentations are great, we provide a rich experience that allows attendees to focus on things that interest them the most. Games and Contests are a major part of SAINTCON. Many people spend their entire time at the conference (and in their hotels) playing the Hackers Challenge game. Hackers Challenge was originally used to provide “Something else to do” during less interesting presentations, but has become a serious and high skills driven game that the attendees love to play.

3. **How much does it cost to attend SAINTCON?**
   - Somewhere between $200-$300. SAINTCON ticket costs change from year-to-year based on the projected costs for the conference. As a general cost-recovery conference, we will set the cost as low as possible to cover costs with a small margin of surplus to cover unexpected costs should they arise.

4. **Will I get hacked at SAINTCON?**
   - Probably not! We do a lot of security education at SAINTCON, so it may be only natural for someone to be super-excited and test a new skill against their network-connected friends. This is discouraged, but cannot be completely controlled. We recommend that you come to the conference with a certain level of paranoia and protect yourself and your devices appropriately by using VPNs, and other methods.

5. **Where and When is SAINTCON held?**
   - SAINTCON 2023 Will be held October 21-25, 2024 At the Utah Valley Convention Center – 220 West Center Street, Suite 200 Provo UT, 84601.

6. **Is there an Age Limit to attend SAINTCON?**
   - No! In fact, we encourage you to bring younger attendees to SAINTCON. We have expanded this option in recent years, and have found that much of what we do and discuss is beneficial to High School students and younger. SAINTCON has a long tradition of being a family-friendly environment, even though we do not monitor or enforce this culture. 
   - **POLICY:** All attendees younger than 18 years old, MUST be accompanied by an adult.

7. **Who makes money off SAINTCON?**
   - Nobody… SAINTCON is a labor of love and has no paid staff. The planning committee only receives our gratitude and a couple of thank-you items and perks for their year-long work. Several years ago we started providing compensation for contractors and enhanced content providers for things like: Trainings, Keynotes, Badge design, etc. These honorariums are very reasonable and often barely cover the cost of their time. SAINTCON is a non-profit endeavor, and we spend nearly every dollar we collect from registration on the event each year. We usually end up with around $15-20k/yr of surplus that we retain in a budget for the next year startup costs, and to pay organization bills (storage leases, subscriptions, accounting, etc.).

8. **What are Minibadges and why are they so popular?**
   - Loosely defined, MiniBadges are small electronic-based components, usually approximately 1” by 1” square designed on a circuit-board. MiniBadges are generally designed to plug into the SAINTCON Conference Badge for power and sometimes more. The MiniBadge concept was the original brain-child of “zZq” and shared with the UtahSAINT Community. Since the beginning, MiniBadge popularity has exploded with the average number of MiniBadges each year is well over the 17000. Over the years, we have seen some incredibly creative designs, and many from individuals with little to no design experience. Each year we are impressed to see how many new designs appear. It is VERY common to now have ~8-10% of conference attendees bringing their own minibadges to SAINTCON to trade. We highly encourage newcomers to check out and learn MiniBadge design skills. It’s an extremely useful skill for the geeks in the world. Minibadges can be super simple, or super complex. We have seen minibadges with just 1 or 2 LEDs, to fully-functional computers designed to do various things. Learning how to build them is not difficult, and we have several tutorials on YouTube to help you get started. Basically, the popularity of MiniBadges is not too different from Pokemon™ cards, Olympic pins, or other collectibles. Value is in the eye of the beholder.

9. **What is SAINTCON Family Night?**
   - Family Night is an annual event held in conjunction with SAINTCON where we invite attendees of the conference to bring their family to participate in a kid-oriented version of the conference. It often includes STEM-based activities, presentations, and fun interactions for younger people.

10. **Can I add a training after I’ve already registered for SAINTCON?**
    - Yes! As long as the training has not reached its’ attendance cap you can add a training to your registration. If you do not know the password for your SAINTCON 2024 Registration Account, start on our Password Reset page and submit your registered email address. Then visit your SAINTCON 2024 Registration Account and login with your email address and password. After you login you can select and purchase the training you want.

11. **What should I do if I didn’t receive my receipt via email?**
    - We recommend you start by checking your spam and junk filters in case those block the receipt. We have a self-service option to send another copy of a receipt to the registered e-mail address at https://register.saintcon.org/receipt. This form requires the e-mail address used to register for the conference and will send another copy of the receipt to that e-mail address.

12. **Why are discount tickets no longer available?**
    - For many years, SAINTCON has offered discount tickets for qualifying groups or people. This process has always been evaluated based on need, bulk, and other factors. In 2021, we realized that the logistics involved in offering discounts created a logistical problem that was reaching a tipping point in time, resources, and coordination. So we decided from 2022 on, we will no longer provide discounts for normal registrations. Along with this change, we have formalized two new programs which we believe address the majority of the discount needs. These are the "Scholarship Program" and the "Student Group Program". With these two programs we hope to continue to provide for the needs of the community where finances are a major issue, and appreciate your understanding of our need to reduce the
