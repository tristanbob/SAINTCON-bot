**Event Description:**
- The annual SAINTCON Fox Hunt features two competitions this year:

**Details:**
- Participants will need to locate beacons transmitting Morse code using Ham Radio, Software Defined Radio (SDR), or other means.
- **Easy Fox Hunt:** Attendees can go to the Fox Hunt booth for a list of frequencies and must take a picture of each found beacon.
