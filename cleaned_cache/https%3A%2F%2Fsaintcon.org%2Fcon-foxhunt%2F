**Event Title:** CON - FoxHunt

**Event Description:** 
The annual SAINTCON Fox Hunt features two competitions: 
1. **Beginners Fox Hunt** - Participants will find beacons hidden throughout the SAINTCON Conference.
2. **Advanced Fox Hunt** - Participants hunt for beacons outside in Provo.

Transmitter hunting involves using radio direction-finding techniques to locate hidden transmitters. Participants will search for beacons transmitting Morse code on specific frequencies using Ham Radio, Software Defined Radio (SDR), or other devices.

**How to Play:**
- For the Easy Fox Hunt: Go to the Fox Hunt booth for a list of frequencies; capture a picture of each found beacon.
- For the Advanced Fox Hunt: Start with a beacon frequency. Each found beacon reveals the next frequency until the final beacon, which broadcasts a Morse code message.
