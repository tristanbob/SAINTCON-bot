**Event Title**: CON - FoxHunt

**Organizer**: Wireless Cthulhu

**Event Description**: The annual SAINTCON Fox Hunt includes two competitions:
1. **Beginners Fox Hunt**: Beacons will be hidden throughout the SAINTCON Conference.
2. **Advanced Fox Hunt**: This will take place outside on the streets of Provo.

**Competition Details**:
- Participants will use radio direction finding techniques to locate transmitters hidden in a designated area.
- Each beacon transmits Morse code; participants must find them using Ham Radio, Software Defined Radio (SDR), or other means.
  
**How to Play**:
- **Easy Fox Hunt**: Obtain a list of frequencies at the Fox Hunt booth and take a picture of the found beacons.
