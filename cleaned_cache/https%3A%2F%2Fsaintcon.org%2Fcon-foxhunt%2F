**Event Title:** CON - FoxHunt

**Event Description:**
- Brought to you by Wireless Cthulhu
- The event features two competitions year:
  1. A beginners Fox hunt with beacons hidden throughout the SAINTCON Conference.
  2. An advanced Fox Hunt taking place outside on the streets of Provo.

**Fox Hunting Overview:**
- Transmitter hunting (also known as T-hunting, fox hunting, bunny hunting) involves using radio direction-finding techniques to locate hidden radio transmitters within a designated area.
- Each beacon will transmit Morse code on a specific frequency which participants need to find using various means such as Ham Radio or Software Defined Radio (SDR).

**How to Play:**
- For the Easy Fox Hunt, participants will receive a list of frequencies at the Fox Hunt booth and must take a picture of the found beacons.
- For the advanced hunt, participants will receive one beacon frequency leading to others, resulting in four beacons total. The final beacon will broadcast a Morse code message that players must translate and confirm at the Fox Hunt booth.
