### Event Information

**Event Title:**  
CON - FoxHunt

**Event Description:**  
Brought to you by Wireless Cthulhu. Finding it through technological means makes it harder, but funner! This year features two competitions:  
1. **Beginners Fox Hunt** - Beacons will be hidden throughout the SAINTCON Conference.  
2. **Advanced Fox Hunt** - This will take place outside on the streets of Provo.

Transmitter hunting involves participants using radio direction-finding techniques to locate hidden radio transmitters within a designated area. Participants will find beacons that are transmitting Morse code signals via Ham Radio, Software Defined Radio (SDR), or other means.

**How to Play:**

- **Easy Fox Hunt:** Visit the Fox Hunt booth for a list of beacon frequencies and take a picture once you find a beacon.
- **Advanced Fox Hunt:** You will receive one beacon frequency. Upon finding it, it will provide the next frequency, with a total of four beacons to find. The final beacon will send a Morse code message. Translate the code and return to the Fox Hunt booth for confirmation.
