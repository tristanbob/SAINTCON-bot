**Event Title:** CON - LAN Cable Contest

**Overview:**
- Brought to you by v0rtex, the event invites participants to build a LAN cable as fast as they can. This contest is suitable for both beginners and experienced individuals who want to test their cable-making skills.

Participants are required to:
1. Wire up and crimp RJ-45 jacks on both ends of a network cable according to either the TIA-568 A or B standard (no crossover allowed).
2. Test the cable by plugging it into RJ-45 jacks to ensure it is wired correctly. 
3. Their time is recorded once the cable passes the test, allowing them to see if they can rank on the leaderboard.

**Equipment Provided:**

**What to Bring:**
