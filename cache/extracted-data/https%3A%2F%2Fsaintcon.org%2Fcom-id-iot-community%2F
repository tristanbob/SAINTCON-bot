**Title:** COM – ID-IOT Community – SAINTCON

**Page Description:**  
From the dumpster fire that is Cyberjanitorial crawls out: Spectre and Phaktor to present ID/IOT. Industrial Devices and IoT together make an interesting challenge you should explore. The IDIOTs are BACK! 

**Overview:**
- The community focuses on the intersection of Industrial Devices (ICS) and the Internet of Things (IoT).
- It aims to address the security vulnerabilities of control systems, protocols lacking authentication, and proprietary protocols with minimal documentation.
- The community engages discussions around control system hacking, protocol manipulation (Modbus and DNP3), and vulnerability assessments in IoT devices.
- Activities include interfacing with HMI software, and skills development in firmware access (SPI and I2C).

**Learning Outcomes:**
- How to connect to ICS systems.
- Understanding ICS control protocols and tools.
- Building a better understanding of IoT challenges.
- Managing IoT systems effectively.

**Community Activities:**
- Engage in discussions and hands-on activities related to control system security and IoT hacking.
- Opportunity to obtain a MiniBadge by participating in community activities.
