"It takes an army of volunteers to produce SAINTCON each year. With over 20 committee members, and their staff of 50 individuals supported by almost 150 volunteers. All these support the nearly 90 presenters and 1900 attendees. In the end, YOU are the reason we make this happen every year. It is truly our labor of love and community!"

PARKING
"When arriving at SAINTCON, you may find parking a little harder to find than in years past. Parking is available at multiple venues and locations around the convention center. Due to the number of people attending, we expect parking to be at a premium. To make it as easy as possible, we have purchased full access to one lot, and worked with UVCC to make other parking options available."

SCHEDULE
"The schedule for SAINTCON has been posted to the website and is available in multiple formats. We encourage you to review the schedule on the website and attend the classes and training that interest you most. Seating for some sessions may be limited and is given on a first-come-first-served process, so to ensure you have a seat, arrive at your session early."
